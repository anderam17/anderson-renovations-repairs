            <h1>Meet Eric Anderson</h1>
            <p> Eric is a proud husband to his wife Jennifer, dad to his 3 adult children, and PeePaw to two -soon to be four- little ones. And to you, he can be the contractor you have been looking for. Eric has always loved working with his hands, and has done 80% of all the work on any house he or his children have owned. The other 20% of the work is done by local friends or family that he has trusted for years and formed great bonds with. He puts more than 100% into every project he does, treating your home like his own.   
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p> After flipping houses for 20+ years only on nights and weekends, Eric decided 3 years ago to take on home renovations and repairs full time. Being a very small operation, you can count on being a top priority for Eric. You will not be treated like a customer, but like a part of the family. Eric wants to make sure at the end of the day, you are happy with what he has completed, and will go to all lengths to make this happen.
